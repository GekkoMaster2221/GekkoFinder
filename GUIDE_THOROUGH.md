# Guide Thorough

This guide provides a thorough understanding of the system and its components. Below you will find detailed sections that cover various aspects of operations and security.

## Terminology
### Interfered Unsafe Network (Formerly Honeypot)
Interfered unsafe networks are systems designed to attract malicious actors. Their purpose is to analyze and monitor activities that potentially compromise security.

### Controlled Unsafe Environment (CUE) (Formerly Trap)
Controlled unsafe environments (CUEs) are setups intentionally created to study the behavior of unauthorized access attempts while mitigating risks to the actual systems.

## Detection Methods
We employ various techniques to detect intrusions and unauthorized activities:

- **Detection in Interfered Unsafe Networks:** Techniques used to identify attacks and behaviors within interfered unsafe networks, focusing on logs and alerts.
- **Detection in Controlled Unsafe Environments:** Strategies to monitor and analyze interactions within controlled unsafe environments, emphasizing response and adaptation strategies for security teams.
