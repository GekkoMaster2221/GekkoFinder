   ID      - Network selection number (type to connect)
   SSID    - Network name (up to 20 characters)
   Signal% - WiFi strength (0-100%)
   Location- Estimated location (Country/City or place type)
   Sec     - Security protocol (Open, WEP, WPA, WPA2, WPA3)
   DNS     - DNS/Proxy status (0, DNS, Proxy, or &)
   HP/Trap - Honeypot detection (X=safe, Y=dangerous)
   SS      - Safety Scores (T/UF/OF/NU with color coding)

SAFETY SCORE MEANINGS

   T  = Testing (Penetration testing)
        🟢 Green (S) = Safe for authorized security testing
        🔴 Red (X) = Not safe for testing

   UF = Upload Files (Sensitive data transmission)
        🟢 Green (S) = Safe for uploading credentials/files
        🔴 Red (X) = Not safe for file uploads

   OF = Open Files (Sensitive document access)
        🟢 Green (S) = Safe for opening confidential documents
        🔴 Red (X) = Not safe for opening sensitive files

   NU = Normal Usage (General browsing)
        🟢 Green (S) = Safe for general internet use
        🔴 Red (X) = Not safe for any activity

SECURITY PROTOCOLS

   Open    - No encryption (highest risk, avoid)
   WEP     - Deprecated, broken encryption (critical risk, never use)
   WPA     - Legacy encryption (moderate risk, browsing only)
   WPA2    - Strong encryption (safe for most activities)
   WPA3    - Maximum encryption (safe for all activities including testing)

DECISION MAKING QUICK REFERENCE

   • Some features disabled on systems without nmcli

PROBLEM: "No networks detected"
SOLUTION:
   • Verify WiFi adapter is enabled
   • Run: nmcli device show
   • Check WiFi switch on laptop/device
   • May require root/sudo permissions

PROBLEM: "Can't connect to network"
SOLUTION:
   • Verify correct password (case-sensitive)
   • Check if network requires special login
   • Try from terminal: nmcli dev wifi connect SSID password PASSWORD
   • Maximum 3 password attempts allowed

PROBLEM: "Command timeout"
SOLUTION:
   • Commands limited to 10 seconds
   • Try simpler commands
   • Run long commands in terminal directly
   • Example: sudo timeout 30 nmap -p 1-65535 192.168.1.0/24

PROBLEM: "Logs not appearing"
SOLUTION:
   • Check ~/.gekkofinder.log exists
   • May be empty on fresh install
   • Use 'cat ~/.gekkofinder.log' from terminal
   • Logs only record after first activity

PROBLEM: "Color coding not showing"
SOLUTION:
   • Verify terminal supports ANSI colors
   • Try: echo -e "\033[92mGreen\033[0m"
   • Use xterm or GNOME Terminal if colors don't show
   • Colors are informational only, tool functions without them

DETAILED USAGE
================================================================================

UNDERSTANDING NETWORK DISPLAY

Each network entry shows:
   ID      - Network selection number (type to connect)
   SSID    - Network name (up to 20 characters)
   Signal% - WiFi strength (0-100%)
   Location- Estimated location (Country/City or place type)
   Sec     - Security protocol (Open, WEP, WPA, WPA2, WPA3)
   DNS     - DNS/Proxy status (0, DNS, Proxy, or &)
   HP/Trap - Honeypot detection (X=safe, Y=dangerous)
   SS      - Safety Scores (T/UF/OF/NU with color coding)

SAFETY SCORE MEANINGS

   T  = Testing (Penetration testing)
        🟢 Green (S) = Safe for authorized security testing
        🔴 Red (X) = Not safe for testing

   UF = Upload Files (Sensitive data transmission)
        🟢 Green (S) = Safe for uploading credentials/files
        🔴 Red (X) = Not safe for file uploads

   OF = Open Files (Sensitive document access)
        🟢 Green (S) = Safe for opening confidential documents
        🔴 Red (X) = Not safe for opening sensitive files

   NU = Normal Usage (General browsing)
        🟢 Green (S) = Safe for general internet use
        🔴 Red (X) = Not safe for any activity

SECURITY PROTOCOLS

   Open    - No encryption (highest risk, avoid)
   WEP     - Deprecated, broken encryption (critical risk, never use)
   WPA     - Legacy encryption (moderate risk, browsing only)
   WPA2    - Strong encryption (safe for most activities)
   WPA3    - Maximum encryption (safe for all activities including testing)

DECISION MAKING QUICK REFERENCE

   If HP/Trap = Y (honeypot detected)
      → DO NOT CONNECT - Malicious network detected

   If NU = Red (not safe for browsing)
      → DO NOT CONNECT - Not safe for any activity

   If NU = Green, others Red
      → SAFE for general browsing only

   If All = Green, Signal 80%+
      → SAFE for all activities

   If WPA3 + Signal 90%+
      → OPTIMAL network, safe for everything
